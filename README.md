# born2beroot guide
My progress at 42 born2beroot project introduced the basis of virtual machines, SSH, cron jobs, shell scripts, servers, and more.

### Before start
- make sure you have downloaded your Linux distribution and installed Virtual Box. For this guide I chose Debian.
- if you have not downloaded Debian [download here](https://www.debian.org/download)
- if the virtual box is not installed download via the 42 package manager 

### Getting started

1. Open your virtual box and tap on new.
2. follow the virtual box steps
3. with the VM installed let's begin.

### System Installation

1. Chose language, location, and timezone locale
2. configure keyboard
3. configure your hostname that must be `<intra_user>42`
4. configure your domain name. I did put `rio`
5. type and confirm your root password
6. create your system user
7. configure the clock set in SÃ£o Paulo
8. this guide has the bonus partitions but you can [go to mandatory](./partition_mandatory.md)
