# born2beroot guide
My progress at 42 born2beroot project that introduce the basis of virtual machine, SSH, cron jobs, shell script, servers, and more.

### Berfore start
make sure you have downloaded your linux distribution and installed Virtual Box. for this guide I chose Debian. <br/>
- if you does not downloaded Debian [download here](https://www.debian.org/download)
- if virtual box is not installed download via 42 package manager 

### Getting started

1. Open your virtual box and tap on new.
2. just follow the virtual box steps
